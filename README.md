# Swept's Deathmatch
A custom FA:S-based gamemode I worked on during winter break-ish.  

### HEADS UP
This gamemode is very old and very bad.  
It's horribly simple with hardly anything too noteworthy to sell it.  
I made this when I had almost no experience in this area.  
Use at your own risk!

### What is it?
Swept's Deathmatch is a gamemode that's focused on just killing.  No round systems, no score limits, just pure killing.  Earn money by killing, and buy better guns.

### How do I use it?
Download the whole thing and put the SweptsDeathmatch folder into your addons folder.  You still need to send connecting clients the workshop version of the gamemode, because it contains some models and materials that I won't upload here.

### What can I do with it?
I'm not gonna officially stick a license on it because I don't care that much, but you can modify it however you want, but please don't upload it to the workshop yet.  I'm planning on letting anyone do what they want with the release of the dev version.

### What else does this need?
You'll need to send the content of these addons to your connecting clients for them to see anything properly:
